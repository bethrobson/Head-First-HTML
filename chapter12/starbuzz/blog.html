				<h1>Starbuzz meets social media</h1>
				<p>
					Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. 
					In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and 
					we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that 
					links your coffee drinking directly to your social 
					network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and 
					with this new product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz 
					blend is going to to be shared with your social network.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already 
					testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this, 
					which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social 
					networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen 
					and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, 
					NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech 
					folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
				</p>
				<p>
					So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll 
					be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this 
					new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.

				<h1>Starbuzz uses computer science</h1>
				<p>
					Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee 
					house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the 
					astronomical number of different drinks any customer can 
					order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the 
					way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it? 
				</p>
				<p>
					To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and 
					greatest in computer science.  In fact, we train 
					our staff to be one big distributed computer.  The cashiers 
					create the orders for the distributed computer, complete 
					with your name and the drinks special instructions.  Then 
					our specialized drink makers grab the next cup
					and go about working on your order until it's finished.  
				</p>
				<p>
					With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation 
					any time we want.  All we need to do is add more cashiers 
					and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support 
					staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.

				<h1>Most unique patron of the month	</h1>
				<p>
					Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a 
					customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order 
					is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, 
					with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we 
					have unique customers or what?
