		<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
		<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

		<p>
			Well, I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some 
			interesting	places on the way: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Walla Walla, WA </li>
			<li>Magic City, ID</li>
			<li>Bountiful, UT </li>
			<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
			<li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
			<li>Why, AZ </li>
		</ol>
		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
		<p>
			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>	
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars, <br>
			When you can't see, <br>
			May get you, <br>
			A glimpse, <br>
			of eternity. <br>
		</blockquote> 
		<p>
			I definitely won't be passing any cars.
		</p>
		<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

		<p>
			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything 
			packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to 
			bring a whole lot with me: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>cell phone</li>
			<li>iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>and a protein bar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A
			journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
