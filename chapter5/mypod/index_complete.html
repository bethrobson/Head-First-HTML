      <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
      <p>
         Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be.
         Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod, from the early classic 
         iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest 
         iPod Video, and a digital camera.  Just take a snapshot of your iPod in
         your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what 
         are you waiting for?
